            And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
          </span>

          <span>
            And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br/>
            And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;
          </span>

          <span>
            Robins will wear their feathery fire<br/>
            Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
          </span>

          <span>
            And not one will know of the war, not one<br/>
            Will care at last when it is done.
          </span>

          <span>
            Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree<br/>
            If mankind perished utterly;
          </span>

          <span>
            And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,<br/>
            Would scarcely know that we were gone.
